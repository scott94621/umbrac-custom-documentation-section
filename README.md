# Custom documentation

This is an Umbraco package (WIP) where the goal is for project developers to easily be able to write down what a specific data type, doc type, grid editor, custom section, anything really, does.  

## TODO

* Make html be an accepted view
* Make txt be an accepted view
* Publish?
* Add dashboard for editing
